      <description>Status: Ongoing Research&#xA;📄 Abstract The limited availability of annotated medical imaging data remains a critical barrier in developing robust deep learning models, particularly in breast Ultrasound (US). This study presents a novel conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework tailored for synthesizing high-quality breast US images in data-constrained environments.&#xA;🔬 Methodology Our method is evaluated on 100 US images (one of the smallest publicly available breast US datasets) from the Open Access Series of Breast US Dataset (OASBUD), simulating real-world clinical scarcity.</description>
