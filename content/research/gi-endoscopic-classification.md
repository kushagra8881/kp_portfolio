## 📚 Publication

**Biomedical Physics & Engineering Express** (IOP Publishing)

## Overview

This research focuses on making deep learning models interpretable for medical diagnosis, specifically for gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopic image classification.

## 🔬 Research Contributions

### Interpretable AI for Healthcare
- Applied **EfficientNet** architecture for multi-class GI diagnosis
- Integrated **Grad-CAM** for visual explanations of model decisions
- Implemented **LIME** (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)
- Achieved **transparent multi-class diagnosis**

### Key Innovations
- Combined state-of-the-art accuracy with interpretability
- Enabled clinicians to understand model reasoning
- Validated on real-world endoscopic image datasets

## 🎯 Impact

This work bridges the gap between high-performing deep learning models and clinical adoption by providing transparent, interpretable diagnoses that healthcare professionals can trust and verify.
