## 🔬 Ongoing Research

## Overview

This research explores the use of **Wasserstein GANs (WGANs)** to generate synthetic medical images for breast cancer detection, addressing the critical challenge of limited medical imaging datasets.

## 🎯 Research Goals

### Data Augmentation
- Apply **Wasserstein GANs** with label smoothing
- Generate high-quality **synthetic medical images**
- **Triple limited datasets** for improved model training

### Improved Detection
- Enhance **robustness** of cancer detection models
- Address **class imbalance** in medical datasets
- Improve **generalization** across diverse patient populations

## 🔧 Methodology

### WGAN Architecture
- Generator network for realistic image synthesis
- Critic network for quality assessment
- Wasserstein distance for stable training

### Label Smoothing
- Regularization technique for improved generation
- Better gradient flow during training
- More realistic synthetic samples

## 📊 Expected Outcomes

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
